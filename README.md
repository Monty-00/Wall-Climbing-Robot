# Wall-Climbing-Robot
Srishti 2020
## Abstract
It is a manually controlled bot. It can be moved in a 2D space on the wall. It is a small bot which can stay on the wall for any amount of time. 

## Motivation

## Mechanical Aspect
1. The whole syster should be lighter and stong. So we have used 3D printing.
2. For giving the thrust in horizonatal direction we have used a BLDC motor, So that the friction force increases and the body stick with the wall.
3. The propellor is rotate in reverse direction so it can give the required force on the wall.
4. We have used two small DC motors which give the 2D motion on the wall.
5. We have used a caster wheel on the front of the bot for easy rotation of the bot.

## Electronic Aspect
1. All the three motors are controlling by the arduino with the help of a motor driver.
2. It drives the DC motors with the PWM value signal of 200.
3. When the switch is in Up state, the DC motors rotate in clockwise and bot move in the forward direction.
4. When the switch is in down state, the DC motors rotate in anti clockwise and bot move in the backward direction.
5. It can also change its direction to right and left.
